# William Livernois
I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, having recently completing my PhD dissertation on quantum phenomena in biological systems. My research focuses on **computational modeling of quantum transport in biological materials**, particularly the development of novel spin-dependent transport models for multi-heme cytochromes and metal-modified DNA structures with applications in green energy technology.
